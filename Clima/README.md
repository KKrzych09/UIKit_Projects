## My Goal

As a part of The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp and its next project, I wanted to tweak the original app and add other functionality, namely - 5 day forecast of a searched location.


## What was already done

A complete, single view weather app. The user is be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

## What I learned

* How to use vector images as image assets.
* Learn to use the UITextField to get user input. 
* Learn about the delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions. 
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* Learn to use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Learn to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
* Learn to use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS. 
* How to populate TableView with API response.
* How to create custom cells and connect them with data.
* Work with Date values and converting them to desired outcome.
