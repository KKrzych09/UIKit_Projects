#  Clima

## My Goal

As a part of The App Brewery's Complete App Development Bootcamp and its next project, I want to tweak the original app and add other functionality, namely - 8 day forecast of searched location.


## What is already done

A complete, dark-mode enabled weather app. The user is be able to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

## What I learned so far

* How to create a dark-mode enabled app.
* How to use vector images as image assets.
* Learn to use the UITextField to get user input. 
* Learn about the delegate pattern.

* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Learn to use Grand Central Dispatch to fetch the main thread.
* Learn to use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
